# Parking density

![Vizualization of parking density in the Netherlands](/img/parkingVolkskrant/app.png)

As a project for the Volkskrant, we had to make a data visualization about parking data. The data for this project was provided by RDW, they have a lot of data about parking and parking garages.

The assignment was to find and filter interesting relations in the provided dataset for a potential article about parking. I decided to focus on how the parking density was distributed over the Netherlands and if there were any interesting patterns.
